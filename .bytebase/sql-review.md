# SQL Review Standards

## Table Naming Convention
- All table names must be in snake_case
- Table names should be plural nouns (e.g., users, orders, products)

## Column Standards
- Primary key columns should be named 'id'
- Every table must have a created_at timestamp column
- Every table must have an updated_at timestamp column

## Type Consistency
- Use TEXT instead of VARCHAR for string columns
- Use BIGINT for auto-incrementing primary keys
